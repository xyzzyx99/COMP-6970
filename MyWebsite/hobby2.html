<p>How to make a slip knot:</p>
<p>Before we get to how to hold your yarn, we are going to make a slip knot and place it on your hook!</p>
<p>The slip knot is most commonly used to start your crochet project. You will need to know this, as almost all patterns don’t instruct you to make one at the beginning of the pattern. If you had to do something else, like when your making toys/amigurumi, the pattern will call for a “magic circle”, but we’ll get to that in the next tutorial.</p>

<p>Here’s how to make a slip knot:</p>

<p>Measure out around 3 inches of yarn. Grab the yarn with three fingers and point your index finger outward. Just like making a finger gun! 🙂</p>
<p>Wrap the yarn over your index finger once with the short end at the front of your finger.</p>
